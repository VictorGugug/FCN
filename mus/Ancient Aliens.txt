[0:25] Oh, knowing what we know, knowing what we don't know
[0:31] This is gonna change our world
[0:34] Feeling how I feel, I'll accept the unreal
[0:41] If you be my no-eyed girl from nowhere mankind can go
[0:48] There's too much light, blinding white
[0:54] Your matter tells mine to scatter
[0:57] It's alright, it's alright
[1:03] From the moment that we met
[1:05] I've been awake like I've never been awake in all my life
[1:12] If I spoke your language I could tell you how I feel
[1:16] But your language isn't real
[1:20] In every myth there's a little bit of truth
[1:25] But I cannot say a thing (I cannot say a thing)
[1:32] Without proof, oh no
[1:54] Knowing what we know, knowing what we do not know
[2:00] This is gonna change our world
[2:03] I might go insane if I hear your full name
[2:09] If you be my no-eyed girl from nowhere mankind can go
[2:16] There's too much light, blinding white
[2:22] Emotions, human implosions
[2:25] It's alright, it's alright
[2:31] Right before the kiss I noticed something in the air
[2:41] Molecules existed when there should have been none there
[2:48] Chemical reactions (will wood referencia) with the surface of your skin
[2:54] Some will say my actions let the no-eyed people in
[3:37] And I'd do it all again, and I'd do it all again
[3:46] and I'd do it all again
[4:00] And I'd do it all again (xd)
